      'We all know someone who deserves to be dubbed a "penurious and indubitate beggar." And from time to time, you may be tempted to say that "he has not so much brain as ear-wax." This rollicking infographic is chock-full of such colorful insults from Shakespeare, the playwright who practically invented the art of the poetic put-down. Designer Tim Sanders culled the Oxford Complete Shakespeare to compile an endlessly entertaining word map of the Bard\'s boisterous, bawdy jabs, each one a mini-masterpiece of raunchy, rancorous Renaissance wit. The four-color, offset-printed poster on 100 lb., acid-free, FSC-certified paper makes the perfect reference and decor for an astute office, library, or thespian lounge. Made in Seattle.',
