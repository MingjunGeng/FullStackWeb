# Side Effects

## About the setup

This project is set up with [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/), an npm package
that compiles our frontend assets and comes with an integrated development server.

The dev server runs on port `1234` by default, but will use another if `1234` is
being used by another application.

The API runs on port `4000`, and will not work if this port is being used
by another process. You can easily kill a process hogging the port using [fkill-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fkill-cli),
all you have to do is run the command `fkill :4000`

## Running this project
