## Introduction

Today you'll worth through 7 JavaScript Tasks to practice today's objectives and get familiar and comfortable with the foundations of JavaScript. 

Exercises are outlined in the `index.js` file, please read the instructions carefully for each task and complete it. Note that you may have to use your googling skills to research and look things up if you do not have all the information you need to complete the task.


## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

Using VSCode and Command Line:


1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Task 2: MVP

Find the `index.js` file and complete the tasks as written. 

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start`

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
